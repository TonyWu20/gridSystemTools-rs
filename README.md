# gridSystemTools-rs

Tools for convenient implementations of grid systems in graphic design. Written in rust.

## Goals

Currently, this repo aims to provide simple-to-use calculation tools for graphic designers to skip the trivial maths to get the neat grid system layouts in various sizes of their artboards/canvas. E.g., the alignment of row gutters and baseline grid.

The next stage will be to generate a number of templates of basic layouts with fully customizable parameters, to accelerate the startup of design ideas.
